# Bank Loan Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of a Bank Loan dataset. The analysis includes SQL queries to explore key financial KPIs, trends, and various insights. I also performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations using both SQL and Power Bi , resulting in a dynamic dashboard.

## Project Structure:
- **SQL/**: Contains the SQL scripts used to analyze and verify the Bank Loan dataset. Key focus areas includes KPI calculations, customer segmentation, loan default rates, and trend analysis across different customer segments.
- **CSVs/**: Contains the cleaned and transformed datasets, saved as CSV file, that was prepared for analysis in Power BI.
- **Dashboard/**: Includes the Power BI file (.pbix) with the final dashboard, as well as screenshots of key visuals that summarize insights from the bank loan dataset.

## Dashboard Features
- **Loan KPIs**: Visualization of critical loan performance metrics, including default rates, approval rates, and loan portfolio distribution.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Interactive visuals that segment customers by various factors such as income, loan type, and geographic region.
- **Trends Analysis**: Dynamic visuals to track loan trends over time, providing insights into portfolio growth and seasonal patterns.
